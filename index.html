                            Although Australia is considered quite young in
                            comparison to other countries, it has quite a dense
                            history. This history has lead to certain places
                            becoming some of the most haunted areas in
                            Australia.

                                <h2>Port Arthur</h2>
                                <p>
                                    Port Arthur is a former convict settlement
                                    in Tasmania. It began with a small timber
                                    station in 1830, and expanded greatly over
                                    time as convict population grew. Among the
                                    expansions, a prison was erected and used
                                    from 1833. The prison and sites closed for
                                    'traditional use' in 1877. Today, there are
                                    11 of the original sites remaining and the
                                    site is used as a historic tourist
                                    attraction. It has two distinct histories
                                    that make it haunted. The obvious one, is
                                    that many convics were physically and
                                    psycholocially punished on the site and many
                                    deaths occurred. The other occurred in 1996,
                                    where 35 people were gunned down and 23
                                    wounded in what is called Australias worst
                                    massacre.

                                    Christopher Crawley established the Monte
                                    Cristo Homestead in 1885, and through it's
                                    lifetime it endured a history of infielity,
                                    suicide, murder and more. It's said to be
                                    haunted by at least 10 ghosts. Two are said
                                    to be Christopher and his wife, Elizabeth.
                                    Another, a maid who committed suicide by
                                    jumping off a balcony. The coach house is
                                    haunted by a young stable boy who was too
                                    ill to get out of bed for work one day, so
                                    his master set the straw bed alight to get
                                    him up; it did not. These are just a few of
                                    the homesteads stories.

                                <h2>Aradale Mental Hospital</h2>
                                <p>
                                    Originally known as 'Aradale Lunatic
                                    Asylum', this psychiatric hospital was built
                                    in 1864 to accommodate the growing
                                    population of 'Lunatics' in south-west
                                    Victoria. At its peak, it housed almost
                                    1,000 patients. During 130 years, over
                                    13,000 inmates, patients, and staff died
                                    there and many visitors have reported
                                    feeling nauseous, fainting and feeling
                                    sudden pains. There are plenty of ghosts,
                                    though the most famous is 'Nurse Kelly'.
                                    Aradale closed as an asylum in 1993 and is
                                    now a Polytechnic Training Center, vineyard
                                    and winery, plus olive grove and processing
                                    facility. Ghost tours are also given.
